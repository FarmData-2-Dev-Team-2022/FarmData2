    Time Reporting: Computes Hours Differently in Seeding Report (#477)
    
    * Switched the 'Workers' and 'Hours' columns to more clearly present that hours are totaled together and not hours worked per worker. Fixed some inconsistencies with some headers being capitalized and others not
    
    * Changed the way that hours are computed in the Seeding Report to be in the format 'e.g 2 workers for 1 hour = 2 hours'
    
    * Modified total hours in the summary pages to work with the new columns because they were still looking for 'seedings' in their conditional statement

    Seeding Input Form UI Design (#478)
    
    * Created a new section for comments. Removed comments from the data section. Removed breaking line where comments was removed in data and added it above dates so that it's not so close to the section tab
    
    * changed the text for the radio button descriptions. Modified spacing
    
    * Added two lins breaks above area in the 'Seeding' Section so that they were not so close. Changed 'Time' to 'For' in the 'Labor' section. Spacing needs to be corrected in a different task.
    
    * Removed line breaks as source of padding and added top-margin to the styling in the divs
    
    * Adjusted the top-margin to 45, previously 50.
    
    * Changed 'Date of seeding' under data to 'Date' and adjusted width of the dropdowns to make sure they are aligned.
    
    * Made some language conciseness changes to the text in the 'Seeding' section of the input form
    
    * fixed alignment so that mobile display would work the same way as desktop
    
    * Removed some lines from the 'Seeding' section
    
    * minor changes

    * changed size of the input boxes and aligned the dropdowns and boxes
    
    * component span reverted
    
    * made all necessary changes to accomodate new change in the dropdown component.
    
    * typo in dropdown component addressed

    Seeding Report Edits (#474)
    
    * Switched the 'Workers' and 'Hours' columns to more clearly present that hours are totaled together and not hours worked per worker. Fixed some inconsistencies with some headers being capitalized and others not
    
    * Corrected some table headers to be more concise. IN the seeding's column, removed the word 'seeding' for conciseness.
    
    * The 'Hours' column now consistenly displays hours up to the second decimal place. Fixed a bug where summary pages where not accurately displaying that no logs with the appropriate parameters existed after filtering through the table
    
    * Rearranged the headers for direct seeding. Made sure that the data attached has their orders corrected as well. Summary page for direct seeding has the data it as fetching updated to grab the correct values

    add quotation marks to html attribute values (#455)
    
    These quotation marks are not needed for correctness,
    but it is better to include them for consistency and
    for other reasons.
    See e.g.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6495310/do-you-quote-html5-attributes
    It would be even better would to keep a consistent style with either
    all single quotes or all double quotes,
    but in this commit we are just adding quotation marks where
    they are missing altogether.

    * If the user selects an area incompatable with the area they have chosen. The varaible selectedArea gets turned back to null. This way the user is unable to click submit, until they have selected a new area.
    
    * the code saves the users area, so if they switch from tray to direct or vice versa, they dont need to select a new area.
    
    * cyrpess tests to check that when tray seeding is selected only greenhouses are avialable and when direct seeding is slected only bed or field areas are avaiable for selection.
    
    * fixed up all tests so that they work with the new code.
    
    * merged from main

    Adds user/crop/area mapping functions (#211)
    
    * added APIRequestFunction and first test to resources folder
    
    * took out api function that is not complete yet
    
    * added functions getCropMap, getFieldMap, getUserMap, and getMap.
    The first three functions call getMap. Then get map uses there url and id to create a map that has the id to the name of the crop,field, user, or other piece of information that would be useful in a map structure
    
    * added function for getting a map that maps crop, user, or field to an id. Added test for these functions in cypress. Also added tests for the functions that mapped id to crop,user, or field.
    
    * fixed discription of length test for getCropToIDMap
    
    * all test for crop,field, or user to id and vice versa work correctly
    
    * put in requested changes.
    
    This included changing the crop url and having each function only have one test(combining the old tests). Also put all the tests for the map functions into one context.
    
    * Removed incorrectly merged test code, renamed orig db to work with setDB.bash script
